As a service to the satellite user community, the following description of the
NORAD two-line orbital element set format is provided for the NOAA NESDIS WWW
server.  The most current orbital elements from the NORAD two-line element sets
are carried on the Celestial web site and Celestial BBS, (334) 409-9280, and are updated  
daily (when possible).  Documentation and tracking software are also available on this
system.  The Celestial BBS may be accessed 24 hours/day at speeds up to 28,800
bps using 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.  In addition, element sets
(also updated daily) and some documentation and software are available via
anonymous ftp from archive.afit.af.mil (129.92.1.66) in the directory pub/space.

==============================================================================

Data for each satellite consists of three lines in the following format:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1 NNNNNU NNNNNAAA NNNNN.NNNNNNNN +.NNNNNNNN +NNNNN-N +NNNNN-N N NNNNN
2 NNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NNNNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NN.NNNNNNNNNNNNNN

Line 0 is a twenty-two-character name (this change is being made to be
consistent with the name length in the NORAD SATCAT).

Lines 1 and 2 are the standard Two-Line Orbital Element Set Format identical
to that used by NORAD and NASA.  The format description is:

Line 1
Column     Description
 01-01     Line Number of Element Data
 03-07     Satellite Number
 10-11     International Designator (Last two digits of launch year)
 12-14     International Designator (Launch number of the year)
 15-17     International Designator (Piece of launch)
 19-20     Epoch Year (Last two digits of year)
 21-32     Epoch (Julian Day and fractional portion of the day)
 34-43     First Time Derivative of the Mean Motion or Ballistic Coefficient (Depending on ephemeris type)
 45-52     Second Time Derivative of Mean Motion (decimal point assumed;  blank if N/A)
 54-61     BSTAR drag term if GP4 general perturbation theory was used. Otherwise, radiation pressure coefficient.  (Decimal point assumed)
 63-63     Ephemeris type
 65-68     Element number
 69-69     Check Sum (Modulo 10) (Letters, blanks, periods, plus signs = 0; minus signs = 1)

Line 2
Column     Description
 01-01     Line Number of Element Data
 03-07     Satellite Number
 09-16     Inclination [Degrees]
 18-25     Right Ascension of the Ascending Node [Degrees]
 27-33     Eccentricity (decimal point assumed)
 35-42     Argument of Perigee [Degrees]
 44-51     Mean Anomaly [Degrees]
 53-63     Mean Motion [Revs per day]
 64-68     Revolution number at epoch [Revs]
 69-69     Check Sum (Modulo 10)

All other columns are blank or fixed.
